<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Project Overview

This collaborative project, conducted with [Jeco Cheung](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jecocheung/) & [Weber Lin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/weber-tsungwei-lin/) as part of the DSO 574 course at the University of Southern California, explores the entertainment landscape from the perspective of a television studio that creates TV shows and content. The primary goal is to utilize provided datasets to generate insightful recommendations about the types of content sought by streaming platforms, identify potential content gaps, and determine the characteristics of successful TV shows in the streaming space. This project aims to bridge the gap between data analytics and organizational decision-making, ensuring that the insights derived are effectively communicated to potential managers.

## Problem Statement
For this assignment, we will put ourselves in the shoes of a film-making studio whose business model revolves around understanding and anticipating the film genres and content types that streaming companies favor or need. By doing so, the studio aims to create video content that can be successfully sold to streaming companies. Utilizing comprehensive market share research, particularly focusing on Netflix, which holds around a 50% market share and leads the industry, we need to address the following key questions:

1. What type of content is most sought after by streaming platforms like Netflix?
2. What type of content is currently underrepresented, indicating potential gaps in the market?
3. Which TV shows are successful in the streaming space, and what attributes contribute to their success?

The focus is on understanding the demands of streaming platforms rather than the end consumers, with the objective of enabling the studio to successfully license their content to major streamers.
